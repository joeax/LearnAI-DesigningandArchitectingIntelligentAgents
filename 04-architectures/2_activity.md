# 4.2: Activity (POC) - Reference Architectures and Common Patterns

An Architecture Engagement contains the following general phases. The phases covered by this lab are in italics:

This code-based lab allows you to work in groups to practice architecting intelligent agents. The output of the lab is for the class to create a Proof-Of-Concept engagement (a plan or the actual code) for a ficticious organization, in a continuation of the previous activities.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will be seperated into groups of 3-5 people as directed by the instructor. Each group will create either a Proof-Of-Concept project-plan or a simple POC for the case study below (and from previous sections) for an intelligent solution for bots. The output is a sample architecture to add to your ADS document (similar to the ones presented in the session) **and** either the POC project-plan (complete with team member assignments, flow, etc.) **or** a an actual implementation of a simple POC, time permitting. Include these artefacts in your project folder so that you can include them in your final Capstone Project.  

## Case Study

A hotel chain CEO recently announced in a trade magazine that she is looking to enhance the customer experience by augmenting their in-person concierge service by embedding bot capabilities into their member services mobile app. The hotel guest reservations are held within an Azure SQL Database which contains the dates and the hotel location of the guest that is presented to the application. The bot is intended to handle the common request that guest will make such as setting up wake up calls, ordering services such as a pool cabana or spa session, or handling cab reservations with their in-house cab company. Therefore, the bot should be able to offer to book these services, providing a choice on dates and durations. The intention is to free up the real concierge’s time to focus on informing guest about the local area using local knowledge. It is critical that access to the bot is secured. The hotel chain is a Microsoft Shop. Their network is setup using AD, the databases using SQL Server and cloud applications developed in .Net in Azure. The CFO and CIO has made budget available for this project to be delivered within 6 months.

## Exercise

With your group, create a sample architecture to add to your ADS document (similar to the ones presented in the session) **and**  either a comprehensive POC Project Plan (using any software you normally use in your regular assignments) **or** a simple functional POC application. Note the time constraints you have for this lab work, and if you do not think you can create the application itself, focus on the POC engagement.
