# 02-bot_design

## Overview
This module focuses on the design phase of Bots. This can be either part of a specific bot project or part of a broader AI program. During the design phase, the team would meet with the customer to ensure that the user scenario chosen meets the desirability, feasibility and viability criteria, and that the specific use cases/bot conversational flows are appropriately captured. Subsequently, the design artifacts produced are subject to a customer acceptance process.

The purpose of this module is to assist teams including Architects, UX Consultants, and Applications Consultants in driving design conversations for bot engagements.
