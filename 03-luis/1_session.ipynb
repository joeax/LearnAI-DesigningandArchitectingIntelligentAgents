    "A LUIS app is usually centered around a domain-specific topic. For example, you may have a travel app that performs booking of tickets, flights, hotels, and rental cars. Another app may provide content related to exercising, tracking fitness efforts and setting goals. \n",
    "\n",
    "Language Understanding (LUIS) provides prebuilt domains, which are prebuilt sets of intents and entities that work together for domains or common categories of client applications. The prebuilt domains have been pre-trained and are ready for you to add to your LUIS app. You can find a full listing of the prebuilt domains in the Prebuilt domains reference. The intents and entities in a prebuilt domain are fully customizable once you've added them to your app - you can train them with utterances from your system, so they work for your users. You can use an entire prebuilt domain as a starting point for customization, or just borrow a few intents or entities from a prebuilt domain. \n",

    "The intents and entities in a prebuilt domain work best together. It's better to combine intents and entities from the same domain when possible. A best practice is to use related intents from the same domain.

You can define the \"BookConference\" and \"GetAgenda\" intents for these actions. In a more complex app with more functions, you will have more intents, and you should define them carefully so as to not be too specific. For example, “GetBookingBalance\" and “GetBookStatus\" may need to be separate intents, but “GetBookingBalance\" and “GetBookStatus\" may be too similar.\n",

It may be a sentence, like \"Book me a ticket to Paris\", or a fragment of a sentence, like \"Booking\" or \"Paris flight.\" Users often make spelling mistakes. When planning your app, consider whether or not you spell-check user input before passing it to LUIS. The Bing Spell Check API integrates with LUIS. You can associate your LUIS app with an external key for the Bing Spell Check API when you publish it.

    "If your LUIS app request rate exceeds the allowed quota rate, spread the load to more LUIS apps with the same app definition. Export the original LUIS app, then import the app back into separate apps. Each app has its own app ID. When you publish, instead of using the same key across all apps, create a separate key for each app. Balance the load across all apps so that no single app is overwhelmed. Add Application Insights to monitor usage. \n",

    "Designate a single app as the master. Any utterances that are suggested for review should be added to the master app then moved back to all the other apps. This is either a full export of the app or loading the labelled utterances from the master to the children. Loading can be done from either the LUIS website or the authoring API for a single utterance or for a batch. \n",

Create a child app for each subcategory. The child app breaks up the subcategory into relevant intents. Breaking up a monolithic app allows LUIS to focus detection between intents successfully instead of getting confused between intents across the top level and intents between the top level and sublevels. \n",
