Skipping one phase for the moment, this architect-based lab will allow you to work in groups to add value to the delivered solution by adding more services. The output of the lab is for the class to build on the potential architecture from 4.2 to create an intelligent agent, a creating a proposal to include it in phase two of the application. in this exercise you will proceed as if phase two has been accepted work.

## Objectives

In this lab, you will be separated into groups of 3-5 people as directed by the instructor. Each group will brainstorm ways to add Cognitive Services to bots, for the case study below (and from previous sections), to make them smarter and more effective/efficient. You will create a proposal for this design to be included in your Capstone Project.

## Case Study

A hotel chain CEO recently announced in a trade magazine that she is looking to enhance the customer experience by augmenting their in-person concierge service by embedding bot capabilities into their member services mobile app. The hotel guest reservations are held within an Azure SQL Database which contains the dates and the hotel location of the guest that is presented to the application. The bot is intended to handle the common request that guest will make such as setting up wake up calls, ordering services such as a pool cabana or spa session, or handling cab reservations with their in-house cab company. Therefore, the bot should be able to offer to book these services, providing a choice on dates and durations. The intention is to free up the real concierge’s time to focus on informing guest about the local area using local knowledge. It is critical that access to the bot is secured. The hotel chain is a Microsoft Shop. Their network is setup using AD, the databases using SQL Server and cloud applications developed in .Net in Azure. The CFO and CIO has made budget available for this project to be delivered within 6 months.

## Exercise

Now that you have a potential architecture, let's build on what you have.

Using your ADS architecture, brainstorm with your team which services will add value to the bot and _how_ you might implement it. Don't be afraid to be creative! This is a brainstorming exercise. Create a proposal that will be included in your Capstone project at the end, entitled "Phase Two Enhancements".
